Project Title: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Description:
The "Car Price Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of used cars based on various features and attributes. The project will involve collecting a dataset of used car listings, preprocessing and cleaning the data, selecting relevant features, training and evaluating machine learning algorithms, and ultimately creating a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car given its specifications.
